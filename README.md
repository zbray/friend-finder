# friendFinder

## Description
Create an app that compares userA's answers to a quiz by returning the name and photo of a previous quiz user who answered mostly similarly to userA. 

## Usage
The user will, after reaching the home page, be presented with a button that brings them to a survey. They will be prompted to provide their name and a link to a photo they'd like to present to the app to be represented by later. Below the name and photo prompt is a ten question survey. Each question asks the user a question and asks for how the user feels about the statement or question. After the user submits their name, photo and questions and presses submit, they will be presented with their best match. Their best match compares their results to the results of the friends array in the friends.js file. They will be presented with the name and photo of the friend their results matches closest with.
